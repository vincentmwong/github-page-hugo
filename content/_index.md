I'm <strong>Vincent Wong</strong>, a PhD student in Informatics (Complex Systems) and Cognitive Science, and a fellow of the <a href="https://cns-nrt.indiana.edu" style="color:rgb(69, 102, 155)">NSF Research Traineeship</a>.

My research focuses on understanding how this larger-scale social behavior can arise out of the dynamic psychology of a single person.
